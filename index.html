            <p class="bio">Salesperson turned developer, I enjoy working with companies and their product teams to create the best solution possible. 
                As a software salesperson, I always had a passion to understand the technologies behind what I was selling and was constantly thinking
                of ways it could be improved for the end user. Having dabbled in code for several years in my free time after work, I have learned that development
                is something I am extraordinarily passionate about. I am confident that I will be an enthusiastic, diligent, and creative asset to 
                your team.
